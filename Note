The reason why there are veriable declaration in source files is to avoid a compiler error

Should the server have the ablity to accept or reject modded clients

If the server accepts modded clients it will ignore the name

Right now the client doesn't use the Version Struct,But it will be used when I add commands to the client
structs are structures.There the equviolent to a c++ class
